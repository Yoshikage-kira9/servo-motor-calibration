# servo-motor-calibration
Lesson on Arduino and Servo-motors.
At first tried to make a robotic arm.Later realised that, if certain amount is given, they rotate at that amount but they rotate at different directions.
This is why calibration needed between 2 servos.After doing that, it is noted that they can be rotated easily in certain directions but their initial angles are not same.
To counter this problem, a huge amount of inputs were given in serial monitor to figure out their intial positions.Then inputs are adjusted in order to get the specific output.
